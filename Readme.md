This project was conducted using Matlab during my internship in Shenzhen Institute of Advance Technology (SIAT) under the supervision
of Dr. Xiaojian Li, involving processing the electric signals collected by 256 ECoG channels
from motor cortex of rabbits.

Due to the double-blind experiment principal, I only looked at the correlation between channels
to determine which channels are characteristic and suitable to be used for machine learning classifiers for BCI, etc.

The data used in this project is the property of SIAT, and will not be published without consent.
